# StackPath Serverless Scripting Examples

[Serverless Scripting](https://www.stackpath.com/products/edge-computing/serverless-scripting/) 
provides the ability to write custom JavaScript code that is executed at the 
edge of the StackPath CDN. With serverless scripting you can intercept the 
request before it is sent to your origin server or delivered from StackPath's 
cache and modify the response to fit your needs before sending it back to the 
user. Serverless scripting gives you the power to extend the power of our global 
CDN using custom code.

This repository provides examples of how we believe serverless scripting can be 
leveraged to power your existing applications. You are welcome to use and modify 
this code as needed. We would also love to see any additional examples you think 
could be valuable. Just submit a pull request.
