# StackPath EdgeEngine Script Examples

The StackPath [EdgeEngine™️](https://www.stackpath.com/services/edgeengine/) provides the
ability to write custom JavaScript code that is executed at the edge of the StackPath CDN.
Using **EdgeEngine™️** you can intercept the request before it is sent to your origin server
or delivered from the cache and modify the response to fit your needs before sending it back
to the user. **EdgeEngine™️** gives you the power to extend the power of our Global CDN using
custom code.

This repository provides examples of how we believe **EdgeEngine™️** can be leveraged to power
your existing applications. You are welcome to use and modify this code as needed. We would also
love to see any additional examples you think could be valuable, just submit a pull request.
